A C++17 library that should provide legal move generation and be fairly performant.

perft    -- Counts the number of nodes at a given depth
suite    -- Runs perft on a set of 126 positions
suite960 -- Runs perft on a set of chess960 positions
ttperft  -- Same as perft but with a transposition table
ttsuite  -- Same as suite but with a transposition table
split    -- Runs perft on each move in a position
```
